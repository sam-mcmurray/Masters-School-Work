# Exercise 06: Linear Regression Example

This exercise is based on the tutorial found on the TensorFlow website:  
https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/training/linear_regression

You can follow the tutorial yourself using the link above.

In the tutorial you will train a model to make predictions from numerical data describing a set of cars.

If you just want to see the finished result, you can follow the steps below.

## Run the Web Application

In the `06_linreg_front_end` folder, run:
> `http-server -c-1`

Then use the following URL in your web browser to access the web application:
> `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://localhost:8081`)

When you are done, in the terminal where you started the `http-server`, use `<ctrl> + <c>` to stop the `http-server`.
