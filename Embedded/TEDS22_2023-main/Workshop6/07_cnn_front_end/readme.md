# Exercise 07: Image Classification (MNIST Dataset) Example

This exercise is based on the tutorial found on the TensorFlow website:  
https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/training/handwritten_digit_cnn

You can follow the tutorial yourself using the link above.

In the tutorial, you will build a TensorFlow.js model to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network.

If you just want to see the finished result, you can follow the steps below.

## Run the Web Application

In the `07_cnn_front_end` folder, run:
> `http-server -c-1`

Then use the following URL in your web browser to access the web application:
> `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://localhost:8081`)

When you are done, in the terminal where you started the `http-server`, use `<ctrl> + <c>` to stop the `http-server`.
