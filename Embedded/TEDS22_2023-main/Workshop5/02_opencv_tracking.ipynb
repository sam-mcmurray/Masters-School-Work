    "Previous OpenCV releases included many trackers, but most of them have been removed in subsequent releases. The current OpenCV release (4.5.2), supports two official trackers (KCF and CSRT) and one unofficial tracker (MIL):\n",
    "- MIL is the baseline tracker. It is quite slow and doesnâ€™t work very well.\n",
    "- [KCF](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d2/dff/classcv_1_1TrackerKCF.html) stands for *Kernelized Correlation Filters*. It is faster than MIL, but doesn't handle full occlusion well.\n",
    "- [CSRT](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d2/da2/classcv_1_1TrackerCSRT.html) stands for *Discriminative Correlation Filter*. It is more accurate than KCF, but slightly slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use OpenCV's [Tracking API](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d9/df8/group__tracking.html) as described delow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly, we create the desired tracking object, i.e. using one of the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `tracker = cv.TrackerMIL_create()`  \n",
    "> `tracker = cv.TrackerKCF_create()`  \n",
    "> `tracker = cv.TrackerCSRT_create()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once we have a `tracker` object, we initialize it with the first `frame` and a bounding box `bbox` for the object we want to track. We do this by calling the `tracker` object's `init()` method, passing in the `frame` and `bbox` as parameters. The `init()` method's return value `ok` will be `True` if the bounding box `bbox` fits within the `frame`, otherwise `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `ok = tracker.init(frame, bbox)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, for each subsequent `frame`, we update the `tracker`, by calling its `update()` method, passing in the current `frame`. The `update()` method's first return value `ok` will be `True` if the `tracker` was able to track the chosen object from the previous frame to the current frame, otherwise `False`. If successfull, the second return value `bbox` contains the new bounding box.\n",
