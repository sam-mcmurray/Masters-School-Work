    "# Exercise 5: Camera Calibration (from Existing Images)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will:\n",
    "- Learn how to calibrate your camera from images already taken by a camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calibrate your own camera (i.e. by taking pictures, or a set of video frames, yourself), the OpenCV tutorials walk you through the process. The tutorials can be found using the links below (and also include tutorials for 3D reconstruction, once you have calibrated your camera).\n",
    "\n",
    "https://opencv24-python-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_table_of_contents_calib3d/py_table_of_contents_calib3d.html\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/db7/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_calib3d.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Camera calibration can take some time. Therefore, in this exercise, we will stop the calibration before the calibrated camera parameters are saved to the file system (so we don't have to wait 30 minutes to an hour to calibrate our cameras). The folder \"camera_params\" already contains the calibration parameters from a previous run, so we can use these for demonstrating 3D reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next exercise, we will use the camera calibration parameters from the folder \"camera_params\" to reconstruct a 3D scene from two 2D images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenCV function `ret, corners = cv.findChessboardCorners(gray_image, chessboard_size, None)` takes in a `gray_image` (or video frame) of a chess board and a `chessboard_size` (the real width and height of a square in cm on the chess board), and returns the detected `corners`, and the return value `ret`, which will be `True` if the `corners` where properly detected, otherwise `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chess board image is ideal for camera calibration, since it's easy to find the corners (e.g. using Harris Corner Detection). That's what the `cv.findChessboardCorners()` function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have found the `corners`, we can use the OpenCV function `cv.cornerSubPix(gray_image, corners, (5,5), (-1,-1), criteria)` to slide a 5x5 window `(5,5)` over the `gray_image` to refine the positions of the `corners` to sub-pixel accuracy. The `(-1,-1)` parameter is unimportant, and the `criteria` parameter determines how the search for sub-pixels is done (how many iterations, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we use the OpenCV function `ret, K, dist, rvecs, tvecs = cv.calibrateCamera(obj_points, img_points, gray_image.shape[::-1], None, None)` to get the required camera calibration parameters. We also need to find the camera's focal length. In this example, we will use the `PIL` python package to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we store the camera calibration parameters to the file system."
