    "Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames, caused by the movemement of objects or the camera. An \"optical flow\" is a 2D vector field, where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from a first (previous) frame to a second (current) frame. For example, consider the image to the right. It shows a red ball moving in 5 consecutive frames, where the arrow shows its displacement vector.\n",

    "2. Neighbouring pixels have similar motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a pixel $I(x,y,t)$ in the first frame (notice time $t$ is added as a third dimension). It moves a distance $(dx,dy)$ in the next frame, taken at time $t+dt$.

    "From a user's point-of-view, the idea is simple, i.e. we supply a set of points to track, and we obtain the optical flow vectors of those points. One problem with this approach, is that it will fail when there is large motions between frames. This can be solved using an [image pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(image_processing)) (as shown in the figure to the right), where small motions are removed and large motions become small, as we *go up* in the pyramid (i.e. use a down-sampled version of the original image). See [this link](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d4/d1f/tutorial_pyramids.html) and [this link](https://pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/16/image-pyramids-with-python-and-opencv) for creating image pyramids in OpenCV. Applying the *Lucas-Kanade* method in such a higher pyramid layer, we get the optical flow, along with the scale at that pyramid layer.\n",

    "OpenCV provides all this functionality in a single function [cv.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK()](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/dc/d6b/group__video__track.html#ga473e4b886d0bcc6b65831eb88ed93323), where \"*PyrLK*\" stands for \"*Pyramid Lucas Kanade*\". In the code example below, we create a simple application that tracks a set of points in a video. We select the initial set of points (*Shi-Tomasi* corner points) from the first frame using the OpenCV function [cv.goodFeaturesToTrack()](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/dd/d1a/group__imgproc__feature.html#ga1d6bb77486c8f92d79c8793ad995d541). Then we iteratively track those points using the *Lucas-Kanade* optical flow method. In every iteration, we pass the previous frame, previous set of points, and next frame to the function [cv.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK()](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/dc/d6b/group__video__track.html#ga473e4b886d0bcc6b65831eb88ed93323), which returns the next set of points, along with a status that has a value of 1 if a certain next point is found, else zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below doesn't check *how correct* the next keypoints are. So, even if a feature point disappears in a frame, there is a chance that the optical flow method will find a next point which looks close to the missing point. So, to obtain robust tracking, corner points should be detected in particular intervals. Therefore, OpenCV finds the feature points once every 5 frames, and also runs a backward-check of the optical flow points obtained, to only select *good points*."

    "The *Lucas-Kanade* method computes the optical flow for a sparse feature set (in our example, the corners are detected using the *Shi-Tomasi* algorithm, very similar to the *Harris Corner Detection* algorithm). OpenCV provides another algorithm [cv.calcOpticalFlowFarneback()](https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/dc/d6b/group__video__track.html#ga5d10ebbd59fe09c5f650289ec0ece5af) to find the dense optical flow. It computes the optical flow for **all** the points in the frame. It is based on Gunner Farneback’s algorithm which is explained in [Two-Frame Motion Estimation Based on Polynomial Expansion](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2%3A273847/FULLTEXT01.pdf) by Gunner Farneback in 2003.\n",

Then we find their magnitude and direction.
